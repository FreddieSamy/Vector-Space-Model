the word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which means all forms of animated media.
outside japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.
The culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than japan.
For simplicity, many westerners strictly view anime as a japanese animation product. some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially japanese may be related to a new form of orientalism.
